#1 
--comments: lines starting with letter Z. Don't need -i since they start with 
  capital 'Z'. 
grep '^Z' cities.txt

#2 
--comments: matches words that end in gan
grep "gan\>" cities.txt

#3
--comments: match words starting with A,D or E and pipe it to wc for line count
grep "^[ADE]" cities.txt | wc -l 

#4
--comment: match words starting with a alphabetic char then the next two characters
  are a & r and pipe it to wc -l to count cities 
grep "\<[a-zA-Z][a][r]" cities.txt | wc -l

#5 
--comment: very straight forward. match string starting with any not 'c' char.
  and pipe it to get number of lines (cities)
grep -i "^[^c]" cities.txt | wc -l

#6
--comment: this one needed to escape the '-' character  
grep -inE "[a-zA-Z*'\-]{14,}" cities.txt

#7 
--comment: different from #1 above. it asks for a count of cities, hence the pipe
  to wc -l 
grep -i "^[b]" cities.txt | wc -l

#8
--comment: this one was a little ambiguous. I thought repeat throughout the word.
  Then I realized it could be just be d repeated consecutively 
grep -o "d*" cities.txt | wc -l

#9
--comment: I kept tried matching on end of line which failed of course. Once I 
  switched to end of word instead, it gave the correct output. 
grep -E ".*(.)(\1)\>" cities.txt

#10
--comment: The combination of both word boundaries and keeping the first 
  back reference as 2 ensures that it matches with words are length 5.
grep -iE '\<(.)(.).(\2)(\1)\>' cities.txt
